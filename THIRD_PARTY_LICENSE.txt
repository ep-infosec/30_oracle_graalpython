______________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.

BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON WHERE INDICATED, OR BY INSTALLING,
COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE DEEMED TO HAVE AGREED TO
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

______________________________________________________________________

JPython version 1.1.x

1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA
20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee")
accessing and using JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and

substitute the following text (omitting the quotes), provided, however,
that such text is displayed prominently in the Software alone or in any
derivative version prepared by Licensee: "JPython (Version 1.1.x) is
made available subject to the terms and conditions in CNRI's License
Agreement. This Agreement may be located on the Internet using the
following unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle):

6. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR OTHER USERS OF THE SOFTWARE FOR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
USING, MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. SOME STATES DO NOT
ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER
MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

7. This License Agreement may be terminated by CNRI (i) immediately upon
written notice from CNRI of any material breach by the Licensee, if the
nature of the breach is such that it cannot be promptly remedied; or
(ii) sixty (60) days following notice from CNRI to Licensee of a
material remediable breach, if Licensee has not remedied such breach
within that sixty-day period.

8. This License Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in all
respects by the law of the State of Virginia, excluding conflict of law
provisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any
relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and

[ACCEPT BUTTON]

B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
under the Jython specific license below.

From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
Software License.

The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
License. See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

1
2 XZ Utils Licensing
3 ==================
4
5     Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
6     is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
7     package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
8
9       - liblzma is in the public domain.
10
11       - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
12         domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
13         in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
14         GNU LGPLv2.1+.
15
16       - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
17         adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
18         under GNU GPLv2+.
19
20       - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
21         XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
22         are in the public domain.
23
24       - Translated messages are in the public domain.
25
26       - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
27         are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
28         in the binaries being built.
29
30       - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
31         utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
32
33       - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
34         that are under various free software licenses.
35
36     You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
37     the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
38     take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
39     the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
40     lawyers.
41
42     As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
43
44     If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
45     into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
46     polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
47     naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
48     notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
49
50         This software includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>.
51
52     The following license texts are included in the following files:
53       - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
54       - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
55       - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
56
57     Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
58     pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
59     binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
60     even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
61     package.
62
63     If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
64     information.

=== AUTHORS file ===

Authors of XZ Utils
===================

XZ Utils is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin
<lasse.collin@tukaani.org>.

Major parts of liblzma are based on code written by Igor Pavlov,
specifically the LZMA SDK <http://7-zip.org/sdk.html>. Without
this code, XZ Utils wouldn't exist.

The SHA-256 implementation in liblzma is based on the code found from
7-Zip <http://7-zip.org/>, which has a modified version of the SHA-256
code found from Crypto++ <http://www.cryptopp.com/>. The SHA-256 code
in Crypto++ was written by Kevin Springle and Wei Dai.

Some scripts have been adapted from gzip. The original versions
were written by Jean-loup Gailly, Charles Levert, and Paul Eggert.
Andrew Dudman helped adapting the scripts and their man pages for
XZ Utils.

The GNU Autotools-based build system contains files from many authors,
which I'm not trying to list here.

Several people have contributed fixes or reported bugs. Most of them
are mentioned in the file THANKS.

#
#  NO WARRANTY
#
#  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

5. Time Zone Database

ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

# 7.  Database Ownership
#
#    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
#    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
#    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
#    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
#    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
#    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
#    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
#    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
#    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
#    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
#    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
#    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
#    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

Python 3.10.5



url=https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.5/LICENSE

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

OpenSSL

The modules hashlib, posix, ssl, crypt use the OpenSSL library for added
performance if made available by the operating system. Additionally, the Windows
and macOS installers for Python may include a copy of the OpenSSL libraries, so
we include a copy of the OpenSSL license here:

LICENSE ISSUES
==============

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

# modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
# production of secondary products from the program.
#
# In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
# modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
# any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or

# writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted

5. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.
# 7. Database Ownership
#
# The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
# document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
# that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
# public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
# not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
# to it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
# Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
# Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
# understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
# with all competent court orders. No ownership claims will be made
# by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code. Any person
# making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
# future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
text is available at
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
(section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
copyrighted.

The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
<ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
that follows (in reverse chronological order):

2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
