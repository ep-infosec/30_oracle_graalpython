"""
Semi-micro benchmark for floating point performance.

This is a Python implementation of a floating point benchmark originally on the
Factor language blog:
http://factor-language.blogspot.com/2009/08/performance-comparison-between-factor.html

Local changes:
- Reduced the number of points from 5000000 to 20000. This reduces individual
  iteration times, but we compensate by increasing the number of iterations.
