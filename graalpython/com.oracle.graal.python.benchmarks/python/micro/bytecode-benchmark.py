"""Handy bytecode-heavy benchmark, inspired by the Squeak version"""

# 77 instructions on CPython 3.10.0
# 75 instructions on CPython 2.7.18

# useful IGV filters when focusing on the bytecode switch:
#
# Colorize by frequency
# > colorizeGradientWithMode("relativeFrequency", 0, 7, "logarithmic");
#
# Remove low frequency bytecode branches (less than 0.4 relativeFrequency)
# > remove("relativeFrequency", "^(0\\.(0|1|2|3).+|.+E-.+)$");
