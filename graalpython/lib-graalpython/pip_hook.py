"""The purpose of this import hook is two-fold. We have patches for certain
packages to make them work on GraalPy. These patches need to be applied when the
relevant packages are unpacked. Additionally, we want certain packages to always
prefer known versions if that agrees with the version spec the user of pip
install or the package has specified in its requirements.

The PipInstallLoader takes care of the latter - when packages are installed
through the "install" or "wheel" commands, the argument version specs are
parsed, we look up which patches we have for the package (if any). If we have
only patches for a few specific versions for that packages, and one or more of
these match the version-range that was requested, we narrow the version spec to
request the best specific package version that we have a patch for. If we have a
generic patch file for a package in addition to specific, versioned patches, we
do not narrow. The assumption is that a generic patch file means we can work
with any version of the package, and the specific ones just fix issues we have
with specific versions.

The PipUnpackLoader takes care of the former - once we are unpacking a package,
we need to apply the most specific patch we have for it.
