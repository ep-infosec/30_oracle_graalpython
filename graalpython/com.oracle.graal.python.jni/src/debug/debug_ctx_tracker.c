/* ~~~ debug mode implementation of HPyTracker ~~~

   This is a bit special and it's worth explaining what is going on.

   The HPyTracker functions need their own debug mode implementation because
   the debug mode needs to be aware of when a DHPy is closed, for the same
   reason for why we need debug_ctx_Close.

   So, in theory here we should have our own implementation of a
   DebugHPyTracker which manages a growable list of handles, and which calls
   debug_ctx_Close at the end. But, we ALREADY have the logic available, it's
   implemented in ctx_tracker.c.

   So, we can share some functions but note that the tracker will not store
   universal handles but debug handles.

   Since we already have some special (and faster) implementation for
   'ctx_Tracker_Add' and 'ctx_Tracker_Close', we need to have a separate debug
   mode implementation for them.
